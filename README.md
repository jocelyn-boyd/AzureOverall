# AzureOverall

## Overview
  - Recipes are fetched from the Spoonacular Recipe API: https://spoonacular.com/food-api
  - Search api for recipes

- A native Swift iOS application. Either Swift or Objective-C are acceptable.

- The **Browse Screen** should have a search bar and a collection view. By default, nothing should be loaded. Searching for a keyword in the search bar should load a list of recipes into the Collection View. Each cell should display the recipe's image, the recipe's title, the number of servings, and the time it takes to prepare.


## Bonus Features

- Allowing the user to search by a specific `diet` in the Browse Screen
- Animations for adding elements to your cart
- Sections in the Browse Screen that separate recipes by how much time it will take to make them.  Include at least 3 sections (Ex: "Quick", "Reasonable", "Time-Intensive").
